<h2>Description</h2>
<em>This Plainsfolk dish took me many tries to learn. A lot of whisking makes my fins hurt. Eventually, the merchant at Reunion stopped selling me dodo eggs -- something about wasting food and being ungrateful -- so I needed a clever disguise to purchase their wares. I borroed some pages from Seigetsu's books and made a clever hat, but it did not work, and I had to ask Mogria for help. Also please fo not tell Seigetsu; he has many books and will probably not notice, no, no.</em>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<h3>Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon tonkatsu sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons ketchup</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Rice</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1/4 onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 shiitake mushrooms</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons frozen peas</li>
        <li>1 cup cooked rice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
</ul>

<h3>Per Serving</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 duck eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons goat milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon canola oil</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk together the ingredients in a small saucepan. Heat over medium-high heat and cook until heated throughout and well combined, about 2 minutes. Set aside until you are ready to serve.</li><br>
        <li>Place butter in a medium pan over medium-high heat and allow to melt. Add the onion and mushrooms. Cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the frozen peas and cook for another minute. Season generously with salt and pepper.</li><br>
        <li>Add the rice, ketchup, and soy sauce to the pan and stir until combined. Season with additional salt and pepper, if needed. Remove from the heat and divide the rice into two portions.</li><br>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk. Heat a medium frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the canola oil and allow it to heat up.</li><br>
        <li>Add the eggs to the pan and whisk for a couple of seconds. Tilt the pan and cover the bottom with the eggs. Reduce the heat to low and let the bottom of the eggs completely set. The top will be a bit runny.</li><br>
        <li>Place one of the rice portions on top of the eggs. Take the edges of the eggs and wrap the sides of the rice. This will not cover the rice completely. Cook until the egg has mostly set.</li><br>
        <li>Move the omelette to one side othe pan and carefully flip on to a plate so the eggs are face up and the rice is hidden. Using a paper towel, shape the onelette into a pointed oval. Cover with a generous portion of the sauce.</li><br>
        <li>Repeat to make another omelette with the remaining rice.</li>
    </ol>
